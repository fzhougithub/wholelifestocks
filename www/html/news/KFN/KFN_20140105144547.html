  <p>KKR Financial Holdings LLC. (<a href='http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/kfn' title='KKR Financial Holdings LLC'>KFN</a>) FBR Fall Investor Conference Call December  3, 2013  1:35 PM ET</p><p><strong>Scott J. Valentin &ndash; FBR Capital Markets</strong></p>
<p>Well, thanks everyone for joining us today, the afternoon session of the 2013 FBR Conference. I&rsquo;m Scott Valentin, the Specialty Finance Analyst with FBR, with us today is KKR Financial, KFN ticker; with us is Craig Farr, President and CEO also Mike McFerran, CFO and COO and Pam Testani, Head of Investor Relations. So it&rsquo;s going to be a fireside chat format, I have a bunch of prepared questions, I&rsquo;ll ask those and then near the end, we&rsquo;ll turn it over to any audience questions.</p>
<p>And so first I&rsquo;ll start with I guess on the third quarter earnings call, a little bit of shift change in strategy and just I guess go through three points maybe that kind of drove that shift maybe talk about it?</p>
<p><strong>Craig J. Farr</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, I think a lot of it was, we spent a lot of time, as I took the new position and spent time with shareholders trying to understand how people looked at the story and there was clearly a view that, it [inaudible] too many strategies in terms of how to analyze their earnings power and put it in the right bucket [inaudible] companies.</p>
<p>So one key component of the strategy was simplify the strategy, but go back to more recurring cash interests as much as possible, so that over time we can do comps against more specialty finance companies rather than quite frankly a mix between the REITs and MLPs, BDC it was - the feedback we got from shareholders was that it was hard to have us exactly what - where to put that.</p>
<p>And then I think we balanced with that the desire to make sure again with a lot of predictability we can show an interest margin in the marketplace so that people get comfort on the dividend growth and we had a lot of investments to that point and energy in real estate, we have a little more J-curve components to them and wanted to get a refocus back on some of the cash building strategies like CLOs, and then I think the last component of that is the area in the marketplace where we saw probably the best risk award beyond CLOs relative to traditional credit, is there is a lot of money chasing traditional credit right now, when you look at the BDC space it&rsquo;s a fairly crowded area right now.</p>
<p>And where we saw the most opportunity set today, and where we thought our duration to capital and most people awarded was in some of these longer dated asset opportunities like the maritime finance situation and other longer dated asset opportunities we&rsquo;re looking at, we&rsquo;re seeing teams come out of these European banks, we&rsquo;re seeing a lack of lending on some of the long duration assets because of Basel III and we feel over time that KFN will get a better multiple book if they can invest in those types of franchises where it&rsquo;s harder for the market to get access to those asset classes, as an example those today in the marketplaces.</p>
<p><strong>Scott J. Valentin &ndash; FBR Capital Markets</strong></p>
<p>And in terms of one of the question I get from investors is the publicly traded partnership, PTP, and I guess the outcome of that is the K-1 filings and impediment [inaudible] for some people to deal with on a back office basis, I know you&rsquo;ve dealt with that obviously for three years. Your thought process there and that&rsquo;s something that you to keep, stay with the PTP strategy?</p>
<p><strong>Craig J. Farr</strong></p>
<p>Sure, well, it is certainly something we heard a lot of as well, as we talk to different shareholders to your point, and certainly in some cases seems to be an impediment to people buying our stock but if you look today and whether it&rsquo;s Blackstone, whether it&rsquo;s KKR&rsquo;s parent stock, whether it&rsquo;s Apollo, those are all PTP K-1s [inaudible] managed to now in most cases traded obviously multiple to book value, and people are getting over that hurdle. It&rsquo;s still something we&rsquo;re going to keep attacking and looking at, I think we felt like the first thing to do was re-orient the market around the asset strategy and we&rsquo;ll keep looking at more ways to be efficient on the corporate structure.</p>
<p>But it felt like but more importantly it was making sure we had the assets positioned the right way, that as again as those other alternative managers showed that people can get over that PTP K-1 issue, they&rsquo;ve clearly shown that when you look at the diversity of shoulders now in KKR&rsquo;s parent stock or in Apollo and Blackstone.</p>
<p><strong>Scott J. Valentin &ndash; FBR Capital Markets</strong></p>
<p>And in terms of the new strategy, I know that the previously KFN had one kind of a goal of being ten year treasury plus 1000 basis points as kind of the targeted return goal, and I guess to your point about the investment classes and you are going after, some of it was more higher return but long dated and now with the switch maybe to more near-term cash flow is there a return trade off there do you think?</p>
<p><strong>Craig J. Farr</strong></p>
<p>I think there is some return trade off and which we signal on the call, and but we think over time having that balancing between yield and growth and we thought we got a little out of kilter towards maybe too much growth and now we needed to kilter back a little to the yield; it doesn&rsquo;t mean over time to your point we won&rsquo;t look at total return strategies and look for other ways to grow like the maritime finance situation, but I think as it relates to specially investing in securities, we like CLO equities because it&rsquo;s very cash yielding and wanted to definitely reemphasize that we believe that it was important to get back into that asset-class because the way we looked at again a risk reward and comparing today where you see someone financing a middle market second lien or mezzanine security and in many cases have had 8% to 9%, and if you can generate call it 12% to 15% cash on cash yield in a long dated CLO, in a diversified portfolio, it just looks to us like it is a better risk reward today than buying those securities. So I wouldn&rsquo;t say it was always about less total return to your point, I think there is cases where actually it&rsquo;s more yield and more return like CLOs but I think we definitely want to make sure we&rsquo;re balancing that cash flow versus total return.</p>
<p><strong>Scott J. Valentin &ndash; FBR Capital Markets</strong></p>
<p>And in terms of the, what I call I guess legacy assets or natural resources and maybe some other assets, and you&rsquo;ve monetized some of the high-yield, you guys were providers in the crisis, so you had great pricing, saw prices come back, monetized some of that, is there any thought about monetizing maybe some of the assets you have now that wouldn&rsquo;t fit the bucket going forward, or is it just investment what you have, run the asset out and that&rsquo;s kind of the strategy?</p>
<p><strong>Craig J. Farr</strong></p>
<p>I think we are generally, and we had the discussion earlier on and that&rsquo;s what we have in running these assets out but at the same time we&rsquo;ll consistently evaluate new opportunities and if we see a higher returning opportunities the first thing we&rsquo;re going to look at is whether we can sell assets of some of these non-core strategies to fund that growth before we&rsquo;d ever even consider equity or any other type of form of currency, so I think that will always be the first focus on funding new growth initiatives. But I think in the meantime we don&rsquo;t want to have that drag of selling those assets until we evaluate the right opportunities.</p>
<p><strong>Scott J. Valentin &ndash; FBR Capital Markets</strong></p>
<p>Okay. And looking at in terms of, you mentioned the dividend in the third quarter EPS, reported EPS was lower, but there was some adjustments there, so even kind of the adjusted EPS below the dividend, the Board chose the rate of dividend about 5%, so is it fair to interpret that as being that you believe the earnings power long-term is there for the balance sheet, even with the change in strategy, to support the dividend and that&rsquo;s why the Board felt comfortable enough to say, okay, even though this quarter the dividend we think will eventually catch up going forward.</p>
<p><strong>Craig J. Farr</strong></p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why we reviewed our script with the Board and made sure that as we said in the earnings script that the Board by raising the dividend was endorsing that view, obviously I can&rsquo;t speak to the Board but they clearly had to evaluate that and felt comfortable raising the dividend on the basis we just mentioned that we got to grow the dividend over time.</p>
<p><strong>Scott J. Valentin &ndash; FBR Capital Markets</strong></p>
<p>And in terms of some of the J-curve investments when do you expect those to start kind of [inaudible] to the bottom line in terms of generating cash flow?</p>
<p><strong>Michael R. McFerran</strong></p>
<p>The natural resources we&rsquo;re starting to see it, last quarter we started seeing positive income on that portfolio on a blended basis, the commercial real estate portfolio are early days on, most of that capital has gone on the ground, $150 million in the last 12 months, we&rsquo;d start seeing some income return on that in 2014, and we really thought by the end of 2014 that would probably start hitting this run rate, allow that capital in development opportunities or repositioning of existing assets, so we went into the deal knowing that J-curve was there but to date everything is progressing kind of as we expected especially on the real estate front, so I think we are getting off the curve and we said later &rsquo;14 where we kind of start hitting more of a base with that.</p>
<p><strong>Scott J. Valentin &ndash; FBR Capital Markets</strong></p>
<p>And comparing the return on those assets where do you see those returns coming mid high teens versus say the bank debt&rsquo;s probably lower than that, but in terms of CLO equity, kind of low teens, is that?</p>
<p><strong>Craig J. Farr</strong></p>
<p>Yeah I think the real estate [inaudible] other asset class right now but it&rsquo;s probably in the mid teens and I think in energy we are &ndash; we said in the call because of some of the underperformance that&rsquo;s looking like - and expect to return more in the 10 to 11 that type of [inaudible] rate, and I think CLOs, we see scenarios where we can still buy [inaudible] in the mid teens in some cases or at prices.</p>
<p><strong>Scott J. Valentin &ndash; FBR Capital Markets</strong></p>
<p>And the other question I get from investors is stock trading below book value, below economic value, again being a specialty finance company, being capital market dependent, it&rsquo;s kind of tough, but at what point - is there a point where the stock becomes so cheap that you guys say okay the risk adjusted return of buying our stock versus incremental dollar investments makes sense to buy back stock.</p>
<p><strong>Craig J. Farr</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, I think we absolutely have to evaluate that and will evaluate that just as we talked about with asset sales to fund growth, we&rsquo;ll look at - we should look at buying our stock as another form or way to return capital back to the shareholders the right way, so that will always be on the table; it&rsquo;s early days obviously in terms of that one quarter of trading below book but we clearly will be evaluating that.</p>
<p><strong>Scott J. Valentin &ndash; FBR Capital Markets</strong></p>
<p>And then in terms of investment opportunities you mentioned the CLO equity and it appears the CLO market is pretty wide open; we see a pretty good pipeline of CLOs out there still. Is there - I know for a while you guys are talking about European opportunity, issue in Europe, do you see any &ndash; has there been any change in that, is the U.S. still attractive to the issue, is it getting more attractive, less attractive here versus Europe [regarding these] [ph] opportunities?</p>
<p><strong>Craig J. Farr </strong></p>
<p>One of the - so that was positive recently is we recently as a firm announced our intention to acquire Avoca which is a European CLO and asset manager that is going to provide KFN with real opportunities to just invest directly already in CLO - and they just &ndash; Avoca just priced a CLO this quarter and we&rsquo;re not - before we closed but going forward that will be a source of European CLO equity, we&rsquo;ve had that opportunity historically but now we really have a broader franchise in Europe to say to really turbo-charge our opportunity in Europe as well.</p>
<p>I would say the return profile looks pretty similar in Europe to the U.S. it&rsquo;s kind of that 12% to 15% ROE range. The wild card in the CLO market is finding the right AAA levels and those are ranged all the way from L plus 140 in some cases as wide as L plus 160 or 170 so you have to obviously be opportunistic in getting to the market, that&rsquo;s also why we announced we&rsquo;d be open to considering third party CLO equity and as we view that the most important thing you can do in the CLO market is be nimble and find those times where asset prices are pricing at one level and you can price the AAAs at another level and you can capture big ROE for the shareholders.</p>
<p><strong>Scott J. Valentin &ndash; FBR Capital Markets</strong></p>
<p>And in terms of third party CLO equity investing what will be the criteria to be a granular level with [inaudible] CLO or it to be more issuer based or&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>Craig J. Farr </strong></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be a mix between the [inaudible] and manager we are partnering with and we&rsquo;d have any confidence that they are - see they manage risk in a way that we&rsquo;re comfortable with and then at some point looking at maybe the warehouse securities as they got already in there and at some point putting parameters around what they can invest in, I think we feel very comfortable that there is a lot of data in the loan market and a lot of data on the managers, and so you can provide a pretty good risk assessment assuming a certain fall rate or a certain manger and get very comfortable with what your returning equity can be.</p>
<p><strong>Michael R. McFerran</strong></p>
<p>The other thing just to add to that, with risk retention being [inaudible] topic it&rsquo;s been in Europe and now in the U.S. as Craig mentioned in the past we talked about the CLO markets as the direct channel we issued U.S. CLOs with KKR stamp on it, Avoca is going to bring in kind of that second pipeline with the European channel and now you are confident that with risk retentions it&rsquo;s going to create &ndash; risk [inaudible] create this environment, we have a lot of CLO managers needing to think of far more creative ways to access the CLO market, Craig talked about those long tenure of our capital makes us an ideal partner to work with some of those managers who may have existing AAA relationships, a lot of us actually have more volume in the market than we would just issuing our own deal once a quarter or something like that.</p>
<p><strong>Scott J. Valentin &ndash; FBR Capital Markets </strong></p>
<p>Because one thing we&rsquo;ve seen is market seems pretty active and I guess a good way to supplement your issuance [inaudible] buying the equity.</p>
<p><strong>Craig J. Farr</strong></p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p><strong>Michael R. McFerran</strong></p>
<p>Those are different channels what we talked effectively execute on this same theme, we like exposure to [inaudible] subject to the structure and [inaudible] to the management of it but all else being equal we&rsquo;ve benefited from we had several deals pre-crisis that were priced 2005 were the two biggest and 2007 so really at the pinnacle of the credit bubble, we had the benefit of going through the best real life stress test you could ever hoped for of those deals and still seeing deals that are amortizing today generating a 15% cash yield.</p>
<p>So just that backdrop kind of makes you feel far more compelling to want to do more of that in the future, [inaudible] today is deals from a [sounder] [ph] perspective should be better than the ones pre-crisis that preformed great.</p>
<p><strong>Scott J. Valentin &ndash; FBR Capital Markets</strong></p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve seen a list on the high yield sites and you [inaudible] and pick loans and toggle, I mean is any of that leaking into CLO, I guess not, right, or is it some if it?</p>
<p><strong>Michael R. McFerran</strong></p>
<p>It is, I mean, I think [inaudible] half the loan market now is [inaudible] defined obviously in now different ways&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>Scott J. Valentin &ndash; FBR Capital Markets</strong></p>
<p>[Inaudible] the CLO structures today are more &hellip;</p>
<p><strong>Michael R. McFerran</strong></p>
<p>The CLO structures are becoming more accommodating to it, and they are going to have to be because that&rsquo;s where the loan market is going, [inaudible] the other day I was looking at [inaudible] performance versus [inaudible] performance as far as defaults and recoveries going back the last several years, the [inaudible] actually have a lower default rate and higher recovery rate, they averaged about $0.90 to the $1, and that the [inaudible], it&rsquo;s great but on the surface sometimes it can get kind of a bad angle.</p>
<p><strong>Craig J. Farr</strong></p>
<p>I think there are some warning signs in the credit side that we are cognizant of when you see what the mezzanine levels and are they coming [inaudible] in the middle market company at the mezzanine levels, it&rsquo;s very different than coming [inaudible] in a decent sized company at the senior secured level, and so all these being - I think there is a little bit, the market is not [turning] [ph] risk enough in our view and so I think we like the loan asset class because we&rsquo;ve been through more stress cycles and shown that recovery rates are high, I think I&rsquo;d say on the mezzanine side the risk reward looks pretty weak right now if you are pricing - again the mid market company just five times leverage, $50 million EBITDA at 8.5% and just it seems like there is too much capital chasing some of those smaller mid market deals and so I think we are being selective across those.</p>
<p><strong>Scott J. Valentin &ndash; FBR Capital Markets</strong></p>
<p>Earlier you commented on the natural gas investments probably not playing out as high a return you thought, and I guess that&rsquo;s obviously due to natural gas prices. Oil prices have come down a little bit since the third quarter down the low 90s now. How does that impact kind of performance on the investments?</p>
<p><strong>Michael R. McFerran</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, not meaningfully; we have our drilling deals have a heavy exposure to oil, the natural gas, but the nature of those deals in the 90s is still kind of meets the investment gauge and we actually had hedged most of what have been drilled to date with four prices in the low 100s, so we think we are covered there. The other deal where we have almost complete exposure to oil is the royalties deal which was smaller to us, that we did in March of &lsquo;11 for $55 million but I think we&rsquo;ve talked about in the past, publicly this has been a home run deal where 2.5 years in we have gotten all of our cash back, so we&rsquo;re, the IRR on this was going to be north of 30%, so you have oil in the 90s, that can drop another $20 and it&rsquo;s still [great] [ph] at this point.</p>
<p><strong>Scott J. Valentin &ndash; FBR Capital Markets</strong></p>
<p>A follow-up question would be at what point, I mean you still have &ndash; I think you outlined $200 million, $240 million left to invest in the natural resources sector, how does energy prices - those are committed investments or do you look at energy prices and say okay, if oil goes to 80 then we are selling [inaudible] back?</p>
<p><strong>Michael R. McFerran</strong></p>
<p>So most of that relates to our drilling strategy, and the way that strategy works is we partner up with E&amp;P businesses to provide capital for drilling new wells and effectively it&rsquo;s kind of the evolution of energy mezz lending rather doing it in debt form we&rsquo;re just taking production in exchange for providing the capital. The way those agreements are structured is we have the option to provide capital for additional acreage drilling but not the obligation to do so, so within that 200 plus million includes our expectation at similar oil prices remain at reasonable level we like to perform to what we have done to date, we can continue to do it, if not we don&rsquo;t need to.</p>
<p>However the source of a lot of that capital is going to be this decline curve especially of the oil wells is pretty steep, so a fair amount of that capital is going to be just taking the proceeds from what we produced and pushing it back in.</p>
<p><strong>Scott J. Valentin &ndash; FBR Capital Markets</strong></p>
<p>And then on the specialty finance side you mentioned maritime finance earlier, I think at the third quarter you&rsquo;d put in 66 million of 150 million total. What timeframe is that $150 million do you think being invested in?</p>
<p><strong>Craig J. Farr</strong></p>
<p>We think it&rsquo;s going to be reasonably rapid because there is just not a lot of providers with capital in that marketplace right now. And so we&rsquo;re seeing immense opportunities in oil rigs and the shipping space generally to provide loans, I don&rsquo;t know, I think 12 to 18 months would be &ndash; [inaudible] probably in shorter&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>Michael R. McFerran</strong></p>
<p>I feel pretty comfortable we have a $1 to play by the end of 2014.</p>
<p><strong>Scott J. Valentin &ndash; FBR Capital Markets</strong></p>
<p>And in terms of other &ndash;you mentioned specialty finance as being, what other sectors have you guys looked at it, is it in transporter, I mean can you give us any sense of it or any specific?</p>
<p><strong>Craig J. Farr</strong></p>
<p>Yes. Anything that has these long dated assets with lending against them where you see voids in the marketplace. And those are whether [entire craft] [ph] leasing, whether it&rsquo;s helicopter leasing, we looked at rail cars and there is different flavors of all those types of opportunities in the marketplace. But we think that you&rsquo;re going to see more of that. And because what&rsquo;s happened is the European banks, first, were shedding the assets themselves, whether it&rsquo;s the ships, oil rigs, whatever the assets were in the loan. Now, there is a capital formation issue in those asset classes, where you are seeing operating companies looking for someone to sell those away, now the European banks are pulling back into that on the regulatory regime but we see that as a real opportunity.</p>
<p><strong>Scott J. Valentin &ndash; FBR Capital Markets</strong></p>
<p>And when it comes to &ndash; so you mentioned asset classes where the banks are pulling back, but in certain asset classes you&rsquo;re competing head-to-head against banks, what &ndash; I mean, what differentiates or how do you guys compete against the bank that already has a little cost to capital?</p>
<p><strong>Craig J. Farr</strong></p>
<p>I totally agree. So that would be one, right, so the banks are trying to exit, because the regulatory environment and the cost structure of lending against those assets is prohibitive, so we think our duration to capital is actually advantaged in that case, because and the hedge fund capital space can&rsquo;t fill that void because those are long dated assets. I would say when it comes to regular way traded securities where the banks are really being pushed to the regulators towards that&rsquo;s not an area where we&rsquo;re spending a lot of time on because to your point they have a lower cost of capital or funding.</p>
<p><strong>Scott J. Valentin &ndash; FBR Capital Markets</strong></p>
<p>And then the special situations I think on the call you guys mentioned there was a $100 million potential investment by year end, is that still a target that you think is achievable, special situations?</p>
<p><strong>Craig J. Farr</strong></p>
<p>Of course.</p>
<p><strong>Scott J. Valentin &ndash; FBR Capital Markets</strong></p>
<p>Okay. And special &ndash; that&rsquo;s more, is it, I&rsquo;m just trying to get a good example of what that would involve?</p>
<p><strong>Craig J. Farr</strong></p>
<p>There is a number of different things we are hearing. We&rsquo;re just &ndash; we&rsquo;re focused on distressed portfolios against - out of banks re-org data or re-org equity just rescue finance, so we announced one[inaudible] did the Uralita financing, where we rescued a Spanish homebuilding products company that couldn&rsquo;t get financing anymore from local Spanish banks, [inaudible] up pulled out of the rescue financing, we&rsquo;re even doing some 5%, 10% toe-hold positions in certain companies, smaller companies, and then trying to create some operational improvement in them. So it&rsquo;s a broad category where we see again not a lot of capital in certain areas of the market, but it&rsquo;s mainly rescue finance in Europe right now and some of these portfolio trades.</p>
<p><strong>Scott J. Valentin &ndash; FBR Capital Markets</strong></p>
<p>And then looking at liquidity I think at the end of 3Q call there was about $225 million of cash on hand, but looks like it&rsquo;s relatively spoken for if look at the special situation, mezzanine, commercial real estate et cetera, I guess, how do you guys look at your liquidity position and relative to taking advantage of investment opportunities you see?</p>
<p><strong>Michael R. McFerran</strong></p>
<p>We had little over $200 million at quarter end from down from $500 million plus at June 30. We mentioned we were pretty comfortable by year-end that would be either deployed or waiting to be - just for the check to out the door, but committed and doc signed. So thinking about future capital, you kind of put into three different places; one, you&rsquo;re going to have cash flows coming back on a recurring basis from some things like natural resources, so you get your depleting assets and investable cash off and have been doing so. Second, [inaudible] balance sheet capital management who are at a quarter term leverage, so they compare that, we don&rsquo;t want to be [inaudible] one, the average [inaudible] is leverage of about 0.75. So we run the business at a very low leverage level. The debt markets are open, we have an investment grade rating, so there is no reason why we couldn&rsquo;t go back to the markets, either with 10 or 30 year paper. And then the third path we&rsquo;ve done in the past and especially in this environment where credits have been priced pretty tight, what&rsquo;s attractive to us within our CLOs we don&rsquo;t own just the sub notes, we own a fair amount of mezz notes and so these mezz notes are high rated, so we talked about in the past, we owned nearly 100 million of investment grade rated mezz notes in fact we&rsquo;ve started selling in the past frankly whereas the cost of capital we are on 4% which is cheaper than we are going to do anything else with, so we think that&rsquo;s a place we can continue to pull capital out of our legacy CLOs redeploy it, elsewhere give the dual benefit increase the ROE for the capital we saw remaining in those deals and gives us fresh dry powder to put to work.</p>
<p><strong>Scott J. Valentin &ndash; FBR Capital Markets</strong></p>
<p>And then the next question was going to be, basically leverage is low, investment grade rating, capital markets are wide open, it seems like a good time to issue debt; if you have the need, [inaudible] investment [inaudible] that is something that you are considering?</p>
<p><strong>Michael R. McFerran</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, we&rsquo;ve been pretty active in the last 12 months, between a preferred deal and a couple of 30 years bond deals, the other thing we have as a backup is we have our $150 million undrawn revolver that&rsquo;s always to make sure we don&rsquo;t miss an opportunity that we want to pursue and that we need to use that to bridge the timing of putting up a deal in the market or selling some of the CLO paper but maybe we feel pretty comfortable it is not going to be a liquidity barrier for us executing the business strategy.</p>
<p><strong>Scott J. Valentin &ndash; FBR Capital Markets</strong></p>
<p>Going back to the question about dividends - deployment of dividends, prepayment [inaudible] lot in the third quarter, I think they&rsquo;re running 80%, and only run and you guys get repayment penalty income on that, has that &ndash; quarter to date have you seen a kind of more return to more normal type of prepayment speeds?</p>
<p><strong>Michael R. McFerran</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, I wouldn&rsquo;t say it&rsquo;s normalized but it&rsquo;s picked up, you know it&rsquo;s picked up compared to last quarter [inaudible] put this comparison and the second quarter we had $12 million of prepayment income and the third quarter we had $1 million, normalized would be something south of 12 so about [inaudible] one where, in the more normalized environment I see at least 3 million to 5 million a quarter.</p>
<p><strong>Scott J. Valentin &ndash; FBR Capital Markets</strong></p>
<p>Okay. And then in terms of credit overall, in terms of looking at the watch list, has there been any change in the watch list credits and amount, a number?</p>
<p><strong>Michael R. McFerran</strong></p>
<p>The biggest credit we have, which has held across our CLOs is obviously one the people in the market are very focused on [inaudible] we&rsquo;re on $350 million of the senior loan where everyone else is watching that kind of stock unfold, but again how we reserve for and where we are in the capital structure we still hold and we feel good about.</p>
<p><strong>Scott J. Valentin &ndash; FBR Capital Markets</strong></p>
<p>And then in terms of kind of taking a high level view of the earnings power of the company, and the dividend power of the company, is one of the attractions you mentioned growth versus paying a dividend, I think one of the initial attractions was the kind of the J-curve investments with a little bit longer tail to them but higher returns, so both to fund the dividend and ability to grow, grow the tangible book kind of a both sides, not focused exclusively on dividend yield also have some book value growth, looking at, your book value is around 10-50-ish I think if we think about a return of around 10% call it that will allow for a dividend of about a dollar and you guys are paying at about a $0.88 if we use the third quarter run rate. Is that a fair way to do the math?</p>
<p><strong>Craig J. Farr</strong></p>
<p>I think to your point though it doesn&rsquo;t give a lot of credit for some of the upside in the existing real estate private equity [inaudible] as much as we are shifting to be more narrowed, those are still existing assets, still have as we mentioned a lot of that return profile that can be a lot higher than 10%, so I think that&rsquo;s a fair way to state it but there is obviously some other scenarios where they could be higher with a lot of these j-curve investments that are in the ground.</p>
<p><strong>Michael R. McFerran</strong></p>
<p>I think one thing that&rsquo;s an unattended consequence of the natural resources strategy and if you look at, for those of you that are on upstream MLPs, from a GAAP earnings perspective that&rsquo;s not a good business, doesn&rsquo;t mean it is a bad business.</p>
<p><strong>Scott J. Valentin &ndash; FBR Capital Markets</strong></p>
<p>Right, right.</p>
<p><strong>Michael R. McFerran</strong></p>
<p>But the GAAP outcome is bad because you have a lot of large non-cash charges, most notably the way depletion expense is calculated by large MLP businesses is really punitive because you accelerate a lot of that depletion on reserves because you applying it to a smaller base when energy prices are low without getting too technical about it if you view that portfolio as an MLP that would have added $0.10 a quarter if you follow the same distribution policy of an MLP alone, then that&rsquo;s almost half the 22.</p>
<p><strong>Scott J. Valentin &ndash; FBR Capital Markets</strong></p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p><strong>Craig J. Farr</strong></p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a good point that is a better [inaudible] disconnect on GAAP versus some of the issues in the energy portfolio where it returns cash at a different level than [inaudible]?</p>
<p><strong>Scott J. Valentin &ndash; FBR Capital Markets </strong></p>
<p>And then on the one of the things that, I think we point out to investors about KFN is the liability structures really remain solid, you have all long-term debt, no mark-to-market debt, and then on - so that&rsquo;s a great liability structure for a rising rate environment, right, you have the cost are fixed, and then on the asset side, maybe this is more seen in the previous strategy, a lot of it was inflation hedge type of assets so your natural resources, commercial real estate; I think the low rate kind of disinflation or low inflation runs lasted a lot longer than we thought it would. Is there any thought about changing the strategy at all, or are you tweaking a little bit to be given the current environment, low inflation, low rates.</p>
<p><strong>Craig J. Farr</strong></p>
<p>We are still - when you think of CLOs and you think of specialty finance, I&rsquo;d still say those fit in the bucket of reasonably correlated with protection against an inflationary environment because we got the floating rates movement in the CLOs and we got specialty finance residual value, but I think to your point we are probably getting paid more cash flow in the CLOs up front in case that takes longer than we&rsquo;d expect.</p>
<p><strong>Scott J. Valentin &ndash; FBR Capital Markets</strong></p>
<p>Okay. And then just a question I get from investors too is the relationship between KFN and KKR Financial; you mentioned the global footprint that you guys - you are seeing opportunities in Europe and you see across the financial classes, can you talk about what the interaction [inaudible]?</p>
<p><strong>Craig J. Farr </strong></p>
<p>Yeah, so I think on first of all the overall rating of the company, really being an investment grade company I think we believe we get some implicit benefit from in the relationship with KKR, because out cost of capital obviously starts there. The second is the special situations investments as we mentioned those interesting opportunities are really originated opportunities directly with companies, directly with sponsors, obviously that requires a big infrastructure, origination teams, that&rsquo;s really what KKR has today on the ground when you look across Europe and U.S. and Asia so we are leveraging that to give you the unique special situations rescue financing and others situations which we think are very differentiated from buying liquid securities to your point in the marketplace.</p>
<p>And then as you mentioned now that we&rsquo;ve acquired this European asset management we are going to continue to look globally; it gives us another asset class for KFN to participate on the CLO equity side that wasn&rsquo;t there before that has a broader footprint so KKR using its balance sheet to acquire other franchises all doesn&rsquo;t [inaudible] the benefit of KFN shareholders today.</p>
<p><strong>Scott J. Valentin &ndash; FBR Capital Markets</strong></p>
<p>In terms of managing conflicts of interest between the parent company and KFN, how do you guys do that?</p>
<p><strong>Craig J. Farr </strong></p>
<p>Yeah it&rsquo;s a great question. So there are explicitly people in charge of KFN inside of KKR, and that&rsquo;s Mike and I and our fiduciary duty is to the KFN shareholders. And then there are specifically people who got fiduciary to other pools of capital inside KKR and as you&rsquo;d expect their general counsel [inaudible] sit above the law and all those issues and to make sure that they manage all of that conflicts very carefully but our duty is to make sure we find the best opportunities for KFN shareholders just like every other client account as you would have in any asset management business.</p>
<p><strong>Scott J. Valentin &ndash; FBR Capital Markets</strong></p>
<p>Any questions? Sure.</p>

  <p><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>
<p><strong>Scott J. Valentin &ndash; FBR Capital Markets</strong></p>
<p>I was here last year and I remember a couple of specific assets that you mentioned that I thought was very interesting [inaudible] I&rsquo;d like to hear about them? [Inaudible] sold off, developed&hellip;?</p>
<p><strong>Michael R. McFerran</strong></p>
<p>Sure. It&rsquo;s for the stage in development, it hasn&rsquo;t been sold off yet, so that&rsquo;s one when we think about 14 going to 15 of the commercial real estate strategy, we expect to start seeing some cash flows from that, that&rsquo;s one of the earlier deals. That was the development to build single family lots, that will be sold to homebuilders, as well as completed multifamily housing that will probably be sold leased up and then once they have kind of have a running tenancy sold to an E&amp;P business like Schlumberger or somebody who is looking to build, buy something for their employees in the Bakken. But today&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s performed in light of what we expected.</p>
<p><strong>Unidentified Participant</p>
<p></strong></p>
<p>[Inaudible] large investment in some build-out for a gas company, Quicksilver or&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>Michael R. McFerran</strong></p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><strong>Unidentified Participant</strong></p>
<p>[Inaudible] or somebody [inaudible], there are so many buyers for that type of asset today.</p>
<p><strong>Scott J. Valentin &ndash; FBR Capital Markets</strong></p>
<p>That was more the debt security incident, right.</p>
<p><strong>Michael R. McFerran </strong></p>
<p>Yes. This was - it was kind of &ndash; yeah, it wasn&rsquo;t a large deal. It was &ndash; I think we put about let&rsquo;s say $35 million into it. It was to partner with Quicksilver in for &ndash; it was for &ndash; they contributed a midstream pipeline.</p>
<p><strong>Unidentified Participant</strong></p>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t they have a bigger, much bigger cap contribution?</p>
<p><strong>Michael R. McFerran</strong></p>
<p>Yes. I mean, we had the ability to put more, to date we&rsquo;ve put $35 million in, to your point, it&rsquo;s as Craig was referring to, it&rsquo;s structured almost like a mezz piece of paper, where we effectively have a contractual 15% IRR. If at the end of the &ndash;the agreement if they can&rsquo;t provide that then we can foreclose, take the pipeline.</p>
<p><strong>Unidentified Participant</strong></p>
<p>[Inaudible] so it&rsquo;s really insignificant, it&rsquo;s a small&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>Craig J. Farr</strong></p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><strong>Michael R. McFerran</strong></p>
<p>Yes. It&rsquo;s not a large deal.</p>
<p><strong>Craig J. Farr</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, that was more of a financing transaction to help Quicksilver who was looking for capital at the time.</p>
<p><strong>Unidentified Participant</strong></p>
<p>And in this royalty that you mentioned [Inaudible] 30%?</p>
<p><strong>Michael R. McFerran</strong></p>
<p>Sure. So we&rsquo;ve got two royalty investments out there. That one was the first transaction we&rsquo;ve done in that space. And that was getting to a great acreage at the right time, a package almost identical size package came along about a year ago, similar to the first one we bought, we actually tried buying the second package at 2x what we paid for the first one and we could won it. So that&rsquo;s kind of reflective of what we think the market is on at. We&rsquo;ve done a joint venture with an E&amp;P business to go ahead and acquire acreage that they plan to develop and manage for future royalty production. That&rsquo;s going to be a little bit [we&rsquo;re talking] [ph] key business from J curve that more back dated as they need to acquire the property they need to drill at, so that&rsquo;s probably more of late &lsquo;15, &lsquo;16 cash flows, I think that&rsquo;s going to be at about $90 million to us, we&rsquo;ve fund about half that to date.</p>
<p><strong>Jack Mohr &ndash; Barclays, Research Division</strong></p>
<p>So the returns are 50?</p>
<p><strong>Michael R. McFerran</strong></p>
<p>On the first royalty deal again was, one of those I can&rsquo;t replicate this one.</p>
<p><strong>Unidentified Participant</strong></p>
<p>$90 million?</p>
<p><strong>Michael R. McFerran</strong></p>
<p>You know, that is the investment thesis; we are early days with it, so hopefully.</p>
<p><strong>Unidentified Participant</strong></p>
<p>What I heard is that corporate strategy is to diminish that [Inaudible] I&rsquo;m an MLP investor so I [inaudible], are you doing more of it, less of it, the same of it, you know what&rsquo;s the&hellip;?</p>
<p><strong>Craig J. Farr</strong></p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to continue fulfill the obligations on the commitments we have and then we&rsquo;re going to stop doing those going forward.</p>
<p><strong>Michael R. McFerran</strong></p>
<p>A part of the reason is you mentioned you are an MLP investor. I think as we look at KFN, if people want to own MLP &ndash; when you invest in KFN we need to bring more simplicity to what KFN is and what people are buying versus an amalgamation of part MLP, part BDC, part REIT, part chartered bank, and we thought part of that was obviously shareholders will make their own portfolio allocations, if they want the energy exposure, there is more than enough MLPs to buy.</p>
<p><strong>Unidentified Participant</strong></p>
<p>So the concept is once you meet all of your [inaudible] you&rsquo;d sell off [Inaudible]?</p>
<p><strong>Craig J. Farr</strong></p>
<p>Well, a lot of them going to be.</p>
<p><strong>Michael R. McFerran</strong></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be, yeah, a lot of them are just going to be running off.</p>
<p><strong>Craig J. Farr</strong></p>
<p>Because they are high cash flowing assets, yeah, they are depleting their high cash flow in many cases.</p>
<p><strong>Unidentified Participant</strong></p>
<p>Are you going to do anything to separate that or you just going to&hellip;?</p>
<p><strong>Craig J. Farr</strong></p>
<p>We&rsquo;re thinking about what the right way to your point, to present that is&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>Unidentified Participant</strong></p>
<p>[Inaudible] tell us how your GAAP earnings are understated [inaudible] on a GAAP basis [inaudible], in the meantime your stocks below book value, you guys are paid from the [inaudible] or buyback but I haven&rsquo;t seen [inaudible], when are we going to see that?</p>
<p><strong>Michael R. McFerran</strong></p>
<p>Sorry about the MLP, I don&rsquo;t disagree with you like the GAAP consequences of energy assets is unfortunate. The cash flow is fortunate. So it&rsquo;s a bit of a trade off, ultimately the cash will drive the distribution, not the GAAP earnings, that&rsquo;s what the Board [inaudible] makes a dividend decisions and partially based on how those assets performed that&rsquo;s why we [inaudible] to this comfortable increase in a cent last quarter.</p>
<p>On the share buyback Craig has mentioned we don&rsquo;t have a program in place, but there is nothing that&rsquo;s out there that prohibits us from doing so. So it&rsquo;s definitely top of goal with the stock [inaudible].</p>
<p><strong>Unidentified Participant</strong></p>
<p>So why don&rsquo;t you have a program in place and why aren&rsquo;t you buying back stock below book value, below [Inaudible] below what you think the future value of it is?</p>
<p><strong>Michael R. McFerran</strong></p>
<p>Yes, this is probably a recent phenomenon, so we&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>Unidentified Participant</strong></p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s not really true; you traded below book value for most of the time you have been in existence or a big chunk of the time?</p>
<p><strong>Michael R. McFerran</strong></p>
<p>Yes, during the credit crisis we weren&rsquo;t really in a position to buy. Liquidity was obviously been held to deal with leverage of the time, so absent that&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>Unidentified Participant</strong></p>
<p>Do you guys have a corporate reason why you don&rsquo;t want to buy-back stock [Inaudible]&hellip;?</p>
<p><strong>Michael R. McFerran</strong></p>
<p>No.</p>
<p><strong>Unidentified Participant</strong></p>
