<p>(The following statement was released by the rating agency)
MILAN/LONDON, November 20 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed
National Bank of 
Greece S.A.'s (NBG, B-/Stable/B; Viability Rating: b-) Programme
II EUR4.87bn 
mortgage covered bonds at 'B+' with a Stable Outlook. 
The affirmation follows the recent amendments to the liability
structure: i) 
Series 1, 2, and 3 have been partially cancelled down to an
amount of EUR1.15bn, 
EUR1.2bn and EUR1.35bn from EUR1.5bn, respectively; ii) the
maturity of Series 1 
and 3 has been extended to 2021 and 2020 from 2015 and 2017,
respectively; iii) 
the base rate index of all outstanding covered bonds  has
changed to three-month 
Euribor from the ECB rate for all the series; and iv) the
spreads for Series 1 
and 2 have been increased to 2.5% and 2.4% from 1.7% and 2%,
respectively. 
In addition, the issuer has committed to an asset percentage
(AP) of 80%, lower 
than the 95% maximum AP required by the Greek covered bond law
that Fitch relied 
upon previously.  
KEY RATING DRIVERS
The 'B+' rating of the covered bonds is based on NBG's Long-term
Issuer Default 
Rating (IDR) of 'B-', an IDR uplift of 1, Discontinuity Cap
(D-Cap) of 3 
(moderate high discontinuity risk) and the 80% AP that Fitch
takes into account 
in its analysis which provides more protection than the 95% 'B+'
breakeven (BE) 
AP. The Stable Outlook on the covered bonds' rating reflects
that on NBG's IDR.</p><p>The BE AP for the 'B+' rating of the covered bonds issued by NBG
under Programme 
II has not changed. Despite the AP commitment of the issuer of
80%; this level 
of AP is not adequate to support timely payments in scenarios
above the NBG's 
IDR, as adjusted by the IDR uplift. On a recovery basis, 80% AP
does not allow 
the covered bonds to achieve at least 71%, limiting the recovery
uplift to one 
notch.</p><p>The 95% BE AP, corresponding to a breakeven
over-collateralisation (OC) of 5.3%, 
provides at least 51% recoveries on the covered bonds assumed to
be in default 
in a 'B+' rating scenario allowing a one-notch uplift from the
'B' tested rating 
on a probability of default (PD) basis, which itself is floored
at the bank's 
IDR, as adjusted by the IDR uplift.</p><p>The asset disposal loss component of 58.1% is the major
contributor to the BE 
AP, driven by the high level of refinancing spreads Fitch
assumes for Greek 
residential mortgage loans (900bps at 'B'). The 17.4% 'B+'
credit loss 
represents the impact on the BE OC from the 42.0% weighted
average (WA) default 
rate and the 64.7% WA recovery rate for the mortgage cover
assets. 
The cash flow valuation component of 7.1% reflects open interest
rate positions 
(about 9% of the assets are fixed as compared with all floating
rate bonds), as 
well as significant maturity mismatch. The WA life of the assets
is 11.6 years 
compared with 5.4 years for the liabilities. Fitch's 'B+'
breakeven OC is lower 
than the sum of the components because the agency gives credit
for a minimum 
recovery given default of 51%, rather than 100%, in its 'B+'
scenario. 
The unchanged D-Cap of 3 (moderate high discontinuity risk)
reflects Fitch's 
view that, although the conditional pass-through amortisation
structure of the 
covered bonds minimises the risk of refinancing of the assets, a
transition to 
an alternative manager may encounter systemic and operating
challenges, if the 
source of payments of the covered bonds switches from the issuer
to the cover 
pool. 
The IDR uplift of 1 reflects the covered bonds exemption from
bail-in, the 
issuer's large size in the domestic market and its
interconnectedness with the 
country so that Fitch considers that resolution by other means
than liquidation 
is likely (see 'Fitch Revises Outlook on Greek CVBs; Maintains
Cypriot CVB on 
RWN on Criteria Amendments' dated 1 April 2014 at
www.fitchratings.com).</p><p>Fitch takes into account the public commitment of the issuer at
80% AP, as NBG's 
Short-term IDR is below 'F2'. 
RATING SENSITIVITIES
The 'B+' rating of NBG's Programme II covered bonds would be
vulnerable to 
downgrade if any of the following occurs: (i) the IDR of the
issuer is 
downgraded by one or more notches, (ii) the number of notches
represented by the 
IDR uplift and the D-Cap is reduced to zero.</p><p>The Fitch breakeven AP for the covered bond rating will be
affected, amongst 
others, by the profile of the cover assets relative to
outstanding covered 
bonds, which can change over time, even in the absence of new
issuance. 
Therefore the breakeven AP to maintain the covered bond rating
cannot be assumed 
to remain stable over time.</p><p>In the report Breaking Down Breakeven Overcollateralisation,
dated 8 July 2014, 
Fitch details its approach for determining the breakeven OC
components.</p><p>Contact:
