                    2005 - In December 2004, FASB issued a revised SFAS 123, <em>Share-Based 
                    Payment</em>. Although presented as a revision to existing 
                    accounting standards, SFAS 123(R) is an extensive (295-page) 
                    rewrite of the existing standards. The SEC has since issued 
                    two interpretations of SFAS 123(R). The first, Staff Accounting 
                    Bulletin (SAB) 107, <em>Share-Based Payment</em>, adds Topic 
                    14 to the staff accounting bulletin series and provides guidance 
                    on valuation methods, transitional matters, and other areas. 
                    The second, and amendment to Regulation S-X, revises the effective 
                    dates of SFAS 123(R) for public companies.</font></p> <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">SFAS 
                      123(R) requires public companies to recognize compensation 
                      cost from most share-based payment arrangements with employees. 
                      Companies will not be able to simply recognize the pro forma 
                      cost currently calculated under the original SFAS 123, however, 
                      because SFAS 123(R) modifies certain assumptions for computing 
                      that cost; for example, it requires expected rather than 
                      historical volatility. (Although the original SFAS 123 theoretically 
                      required the use of expected volatility, the computations 
                      presented in its Appendix B were based primarily on historical 
                      volatility.) In addition, companies must recognize an incremental 
                      cost associated with modified stock option awards rather 
                      than account for them as variable options according to FASB 
                      Interpretation (FIN) 44, <em>Accounting for Certain Transactions 
                      Involving Stock Compensation</em>. Finally, in calculating 
                      total compensation cost, companies are required to estimate 
                      the number of instruments for which the requisite service 
                      is expected to be rendered, rather than account for forfeitures 
                      as they occur.</font></p>
                    <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Although 
                      public companies can no longer apply the intrinsic method, 
                      nonpublic entities may continue to do so if it is not practicable 
                      to estimate the fair value of their stock options. Nonpublic 
                      companies applying the intrinsic method, however, must measure 
                      the stock options each reporting period and recognize changes 
                      in intrinsic value as compensation cost. Otherwise, nonpublic 
                      companies are required to measure awards of equity instruments 
                      at fair value.</font></p>

                      rather than as a reduction to income tax paid.</font></p>

                      both employees and nonemployees, receive equity instruments, 
                      such as shares or stock options, as payment. Share-based 
                      payment arrangements also include transactions where the 
                      entity incurs liabilities in amounts based on the price 
                      of the company&#8217;s shares or other equity instruments, 
                      or liabilities that might require settlement by issuing

                      has the right to exercise sufficient control to establish 
                      an employer-employee relationship based on common law and 
                      applicable IRS revenue rulings. This definition includes 
                      nonemployee directors acting in their role as members of 
                      the entity&#8217;s board of directors, and certain leased

                      123(R) does not apply to employee share option plans that 
                      are noncompensatory or to capital contributions. A plan 
                      is noncompensatory if substantially all employees meeting 
                      limited qualifications may participate, the plan incorporates 
                      no option features (with limited exceptions), and its terms 
                      are no more favorable than those available to all holders 
                      of the same class of shares, or if any purchase discount 
                      from the market price is 5% or less. Companies must justify 
                      the classification of plans with purchase discounts greater 
                      than 5% as noncompensatory every year. </font></p>
                    <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Except 
                      as described above, SFAS 123(R) requires reporting entities 
                      to recognize in their financial statements the costs resulting 
                      from all share-based payment transactions at fair value. 
                      Companies engaging in share-based arrangements with employees 
                      recognize the cost of services received over the requisite 
                      service period, while entities engaging in share-based arrangements 
                      with nonemployees recognize the cost of goods acquired or 
                      services received. The accounting for goods acquired or 
                      services received in share-based arrangements, whether from 
                      employees or nonemployees, is the same regardless of settlement 
                      by cash or equity securities. For example, a company constructing 
                      a building would capitalize the architect&#8217;s fees regardless 
                      of whether those fees are settled in cash, stock, or stock 
                      options. In addition to recording the costs of the goods 
                      acquired or services received, companies should record a 
                      corresponding increase in equity or liability. Companies 
                      issuing equity instruments before receiving the actual goods 
                      or services should record a prepaid expense. </font></p>

                      period, but before the final understanding on matters such 
                      as exercise price is completed. In these circumstances, 
                      the company recognizes compensation costs over the requisite 
                      service period based on the fair value of the options as 
                      of the service inception date, measures a new fair value 
                      as of the grant date, and then adjusts the cumulative compensation 
                      cost to reflect the new fair value. Sidebar 1, &#8220;Accounting 
                      for Stock Options with Service Condition,&#8221; presents 
                      an example of accounting for an adjusted total compensation 
                      cost.</font></p>

                    <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
                      objective of accounting for transactions under share-based 
                      arrangements with employees is to recognize compensation 
                      costs related to employee services received in exchange 
                      for equity instruments issued or liabilities incurred. The 
                      total compensation cost is the fair value of the instruments 
                      issued multiplied by the number of instruments that actually 
                      vest. This cost is recognized over the requisite service 
                      period with a corresponding credit to equity (generally 
                      paid-in capital). The number of instruments expected to 
                      vest is estimated at the service inception date, and is 
                      revised during the requisite service period to reflect subsequent 
                      information. Total compensation cost is also revised accordingly.</font></p>

                      of share-based employee compensation vest when an employee 
                      earns the right to benefit from the award by satisfying 
                      a specific service or performance condition, or both. A 
                      service condition is based solely on an employee&#8217;s 
                      rendering service to the employer for the requisite service 
                      period. A performance condition pertains to an employee&#8217;s 
                      both rendering service for a specified period of time and 
                      achieving a specified performance target defined solely 
                      by the employer&#8217;s own operations (for example, a requirement 
                      that a division sell a certain number of units within a 
                      specified period in order for an award to vest). The requirement 
                      that an individual remain an employee for that period is 
                      a service condition.</font></p>
                    <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
                      award may also include a market condition, which specifies 
                      a share price or a target in terms of a similar equity security 
                      or an index that must be achieved. A market condition affects 
                      the determination of the fair value of a share-based employee 
                      compensation award, but is not a vesting condition.</font></p>
                    <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
                      requisite service period for an award that has only a service 
                      condition is presumed to be the vesting period, unless there 
                      is clear evidence to the contrary. Considering such evidence 
                      requires the classification of the requisite service period 
                      as explicit, implicit, or derived. An explicit service period 
                      is explicitly stated in the terms of a share-based award 
                      (e.g., three years of continuous employee service from January 
                      3, 2005). An implicit service period is not explicitly stated 
                      in the terms of a share-based award, but can be inferred 
                      from an analysis of those terms or consideration of a performance 
                      condition (e.g., for an award with a service inception date 
                      of January 1, 2006, that vests when new software is ready 
                      for market, expected at June 30, 2007, the implicit service 
                      period is 18 months). A derived service period for an award 
                      with a market condition is inferred from the application 
                      of certain valuation techniques used to estimate fair value. 
                      For example, an award that vests only if the market share 
                      price increases by at least 40% for a period of not less 
                      than one year over the next five years can be inferred from 
                      certain valuation techniques, such as the lattice model 
                      (as discussed below).</font></p>
                    <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">For 
                      accounting purposes, only one requisite service period can 
                      be used for each award. An award having a combination of 
                      market, performance, and service conditions may have two 
                      or even all three types of service periods: explicit, implicit, 
                      and derived. If the vesting of an award is based on satisfying 
                      both a market condition and a performance or service condition 
                      and it is probable that the latter will be satisfied, the 
                      initial estimate of the requisite service period should 
                      be the longest of the periods. If the vesting of an award 
                      is based on satisfying either a market condition or a performance 
                      or service condition and it is probable that the performance 
                      or service condition will be satisfied, the initial estimate 
                      of the requisite service period should be the shortest of 
                      the periods.</font></p>
                    <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">During 
                      the requisite service period, awards with a performance 
                      condition are measured based on the probable outcome of 
                      that performance condition. An award with a performance 
                      condition is accrued if it is probable that a performance 
                      condition will be achieved. If the company concludes that 
                      a required performance condition will not be met, it will 
                      not recognize any compensation cost even if the award contains 
                      other conditions that probably will be satisfied. Companies 
                      should reverse any compensation cost recognized on an award 
                      whose performance condition is ultimately not achieved. 
                      If, during the requisite service period, the company changes 
                      its mind and concludes that a performance condition will 
                      likely be met after all, it will recognize cumulative compensation 
                      cost in the current period as a change in estimate in a 
                      manner similar to that presented in Sidebar 1.</font></p>

                      fair value as of the grant date. Unless the award is modified 
                      or the measurement date changed, the estimated fair value

                      equity or liability instruments in active markets, or on

                      options generally cannot be bought and sold on the open 
                      market, they cannot be compared to actively traded options. 
                      In those cases, the company should apply a valuation technique 
                      consistent with SFAS 123(R) requirements, reflecting all 
                      substantive (again, with certain exceptions) characteristics

                      share price volatility, but it does require a process for 
                      making such estimates and for evaluating factors incorporated 
                      in that process. The factors for estimating expected volatility 
                      include historical volatility of the price of the underlying 
                      share, the implied volatility of other publicly traded instruments,

                      historical volatility, SFAS 123(R) permits disregarding 
                      an identifiable period in which the stock was extremely 
                      volatile because of a unique event, such as a failed merger

                      a period of general market decline. SFAS 123(R) gives no 
                      substantive guidance about entities without historical experience,

                      Because the underlying security is considered equity, the

                      A puttable or callable share option awarded to an employee 
                      may be classified as a liability if either 1) the repurchase 
                      feature permits the employee to avoid bearing the risks 
                      and rewards normally associated with share ownership for

                      bearing those risks and rewards for a reasonable period 
                      of time after the share is issued. An example of an employee
