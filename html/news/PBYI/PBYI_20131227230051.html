Within this grouping, the neratinib arm delivered a p-value of 0.053, or a 94.7% probability of superiority over the current standard of treatment according to Bayesian predictive models. Furthermore, neratinib-based regimens demonstrated a Bayesian probability of superiority over paclitaxel plus Herceptin of 78.1% if they were to go head to head in a phase 3 trial.<br><br>这一段我是看傻了，上来几个名词，全都不懂<br><br>paclitaxel<br>doxorubicin<br>cyclophosphamide<br><br>真盼望学药的朋友给看看！<br><br>然后就是这个<br>p-value of 0.053, or a 94.7% probability of superiority over the current standard of treatment according to Bayesian predictive models<br><br>这个p-value我一直不懂怎么算和啥意思，<br><br>Bayesian predictive models 这个model是啥也是一头的雾水。<br><br>反正这些都是噱头了，人家进行时候咱也不知道，人家涨了后咱也晚了，只是今后呢？还有很多药股啊！这个不论如何要有科普的。建议雪球真的找两个专家来给好好解释一下<br><br>现在因为是第二期，我从来不看好第二期的，照例说是应该琢磨short的，闭眼short，可是，这股总共28.6M的盘子，每股现金3块多，很可能是机构持有的大明星哦。一查，institution持股79%，我记得当年MDVN和这个一个样子的，你觉得高吗？将来再给你来个5倍时候你就傻了。今年眼睁睁看着TSLA从41的一跳起来后，一骑绝尘，去年眼睁睁看着NFLX的2013年6月的50的call，在股价68时候卖掉再也买不回来。。。都是教训啊！<br><br>问题是确实是二期啊！离三期还早啊！<br><br>有一点是清楚的，这股票出身富贵，方向绝对正确，因为从12年的15走到今天，才二期就这么牛！机构在今年六月疯狂吃进过，以拉升一倍股价的代价吃进30%的筹码，而今天，又是拉升一倍的代价，弄回来4M左右的换手。<br><br>如果没有好消息，这股会沉寂，那是天赐良机，但是，怀疑这股不会暴跌了，这公司账上110M现金，每个季度烧10到15M左右，可以再烧6个季度，如果2015年夏季出成果时候，花光了钱就借债或者再融资，现在再融资都很好，只是现在的机构估计不会同意稀释股价，总之钱不是问题。<br><br>Simply put, no one really expected Puma&#39;s results to be this strong, which is why we&#39;re seeing such a monstrous move to the upside. Not to sound like a broken record, but I would still like to see the full data before stating my full opinion on Puma (the company will release its full data at a scientific meeting in the future). I&#39;ve witnessed far too many cancer drugs demonstrate promise in mid-stage trials only to disappoint in late-stage trials, so my thought at the moment is that sticking to the sidelines until we&#39;re well into late-stage trials might be the smartest course of action.<br><br>这段重要！具体数据还没见到呢，disappoint in late-stage trials， 这样的灾难太多了！<br><br>SRPT就是最近的一个例子啊！哼，我觉得应该做空它！要是能明年夏天64左右all in option， 哈哈。<br><br>在先知先觉上大有人在，机构行为之不同的第一点就是资源丰富！这确实我等小民没法比。但是也有邪门人士，这篇就很有趣<br><br><a href="http://162.243.151.204/article/1716072-the-billion-dollar-molecule" class="xueqiu_timleine_link" target="_blank" title="http://162.243.151.204/article/1716072-the-billion-dollar-molecule" ><span class="" >http://</span><span class="js-display-url">162.243.151.204/article/1716072-the-bi</span><span class="url_invisible" >llion-dollar-molecule</span><span class="url_ellipsis"><span class="url_invisible" >&nbsp;</span>…</span></a><br><br>这里真的引出4本书，我一起买来，used，48刀，估计拿来我也看不懂，呵呵，不过，比起准备投入的，好像知识总还是很便宜。<br><br><br><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Science-Business-Promise-Reality-Biotech/dp/1591398401/ref=pd_bxgy_b_img_z" class="xueqiu_timleine_link" target="_blank" title="http://www.amazon.com/Science-Business-Promise-Reality-Biotech/dp/1591398401/ref=pd_bxgy_b_img_z" ><span class="" >http://</span><span class="js-display-url">www.amazon.com/Science-Business-Promis</span><span class="url_invisible" >e-Reality-Biotech/dp/1591398401/ref=pd_bxgy_b_img_z</span><span class="url_ellipsis"><span class="url_invisible" >&nbsp;</span>…</span></a><br><br>According to Pisano, the biotech industry&#39;s problems stem from its special character as a science-based business. This character poses three unique business challenges:<br><br>1. how to finance highly risky investments under profound uncertainty and long time horizons for R&amp;D,<br><br>2. how to learn rapidly enough to keep pace with advances in drug science knowledge, and<br><br>3. how to integrate capabilities across a broad spectrum of scientific and technological knowledge bases.<br><br>回到PBYI，<br><br>But who am I to judge, the company has tripled its share price since the beginning of the year and, Alan Auerbach, founder, president, CEO and Chairman of the board, sold his previous creation, Cougar Biotechnology, to Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ) in July 2009 for one billion dollars in cash, and it had a similar logo and a simpler website.<br><br>这CEO真牛！<br><br><br><a href="http://www.fiercebiotech.com/press-releases/puma-biotechnology-announces-licensing-agreement-pfizer-development-and-com-0?utm_medium=nl&amp;utm_source=internal" class="xueqiu_timleine_link" target="_blank" title="http://www.fiercebiotech.com/press-releases/puma-biotechnology-announces-licensing-agreement-pfizer-development-and-com-0?utm_medium=nl&amp;utm_source=internal" ><span class="" >http://</span><span class="js-display-url">www.fiercebiotech.com/press-releases/p</span><span class="url_invisible" >uma-biotechnology-announces-licensing-agreement-pfizer-development-and-com-0?utm_medium=nl&amp;utm_source=internal</span><span class="url_ellipsis"><span class="url_invisible" >&nbsp;</span>…</span></a><br><br>Under the terms of the agreement, Puma will assume sole responsibility of global product development and commercialization of neratinib. Pfizer will be entitled to receive payments upon Puma&#39;s achievement of certain development milestones of neratinib, as well as royalty payments for any sales of neratinib.<br><br>从2011年10月和pfizer合作，到今天才1年半！从别人手里拿来好东西继续弄的，MDVN就是个例子！这个也是！<br><br>更狠的是这里！<br><br>In addition, Puma announced that it completed a private placement of approximately 14.7 million shares of its common stock to institutional investors that resulted in gross proceeds of approximately $55 million to the company. The shares were issued at a purchase price of $3.75 per share. Leerink Swann LLC acted as sole placement agent for the transaction.<br><br>$3.75!!! 就是两年前！！！这50%的桩脚就是两年前发出去的！我靠！洛杉矶真是织梦的地方！<br><br>Adage Capital Partners, L.P. was the lead investor in this financing, which also included significant participation from Brookside Capital, H&amp;Q Healthcare Investors HQH +2.23% , H&amp;Q Life Science Investors HQL +2.59% , Jennison Associates LLC, Orbimed Private Investments IV, and funds managed by T. Rowe Price Associates, Inc., as well as a number of other well-known healthcare institutional investors. Proceeds from the private placement will be used primarily to fund the continued clinical development of neratinib.<br><br>再看这个，就更好了！<br>In conjunction with the private placement, Puma completed a reverse merger with Innovative Acquisitions, Inc. (&#34;Innovative Acquisitions&#34;), a public reporting company with no prior business operations. The transaction was completed by the merger of a wholly-owned subsidiary of Innovative Acquisitions with Puma that resulted in Puma remaining as the surviving company and a wholly-owned operating subsidiary of Innovative Acquisitions. Immediately after the initial merger, Puma was merged directly into Innovative Acquisitions, and this resulted in Innovative Acquisitions surviving. Stockholders of the former Puma (including those that participated in the private placement) received shares of Innovative Acquisitions in exchange for their Puma shares, and the former Puma stockholders now hold 100 percent of the resulting company&#39;s equity in the same proportion as such stockholders owned immediately following the precedent private placement. Further, the officers and directors of Puma, pre-merger, replaced all of the officers and directors of Innovative Acquisitions. Subsequently, Innovative Acquisitions was renamed Puma Biotechnology Inc.

Within this grouping, the neratinib arm delivered a p-value of 0.053, or a 94.7% probability of superiority over the current standard of treatment according to Bayesian predictive models. Furthermore, neratinib-based regimens demonstrated a Bayesian probability of superiority over paclitaxel plus Herceptin of 78.1% if they were to go head to head in a phase 3 trial.<br><br>这一段我是看傻了，上来几个名词，全都不懂<br><br>paclitaxel<br>doxorubicin<br>cyclophosphamide<br><br>真盼望学药的朋友给看看！<br><br>然后就是这个<br>p-value of 0.053, or a 94.7% probability of superiority over the current standard of treatment according to Bayesian predictive models<br><br>这个p-value我一直不懂怎么算和啥意思，<br><br>Bayesian predictive models 这个model是啥也是一头的雾水。<br><br>反正这些都是噱头了，人家进行时候咱也不知道，人家涨了后咱也晚了，只是今后呢？还有很多药股啊！这个不论如何要有科普的。建议雪球真的找两个专家来给好好解释一下<br><br>现在因为是第二期，我从来不看好第二期的，照例说是应该琢磨short的，闭眼short，可是，这股总共28.6M的盘子，每股现金3块多，很可能是机构持有的大明星哦。一查，institution持股79%，我记得当年MDVN和这个一个样子的，你觉得高吗？将来再给你来个5倍时候你就傻了。今年眼睁睁看着TSLA从41的一跳起来后，一骑绝尘，去年眼睁睁看着NFLX的2013年6月的50的call，在股价68时候卖掉再也买不回来。。。都是教训啊！<br><br>问题是确实是二期啊！离三期还早啊！<br><br>有一点是清楚的，这股票出身富贵，方向绝对正确，因为从12年的15走到今天，才二期就这么牛！机构在今年六月疯狂吃进过，以拉升一倍股价的代价吃进30%的筹码，而今天，又是拉升一倍的代价，弄回来4M左右的换手。<br><br>如果没有好消息，这股会沉寂，那是天赐良机，但是，怀疑这股不会暴跌了，这公司账上110M现金，每个季度烧10到15M左右，可以再烧6个季度，如果2015年夏季出成果时候，花光了钱就借债或者再融资，现在再融资都很好，只是现在的机构估计不会同意稀释股价，总之钱不是问题。<br><br>Simply put, no one really expected Puma&#39;s results to be this strong, which is why we&#39;re seeing such a monstrous move to the upside. Not to sound like a broken record, but I would still like to see the full data before stating my full opinion on Puma (the company will release its full data at a scientific meeting in the future). I&#39;ve witnessed far too many cancer drugs demonstrate promise in mid-stage trials only to disappoint in late-stage trials, so my thought at the moment is that sticking to the sidelines until we&#39;re well into late-stage trials might be the smartest course of action.<br><br>这段重要！具体数据还没见到呢，disappoint in late-stage trials， 这样的灾难太多了！<br><br>SRPT就是最近的一个例子啊！哼，我觉得应该做空它！要是能明年夏天64左右all in option， 哈哈。<br><br>在先知先觉上大有人在，机构行为之不同的第一点就是资源丰富！这确实我等小民没法比。但是也有邪门人士，这篇就很有趣<br><br><a href=\"http://162.243.151.204/article/1716072-the-billion-dollar-molecule\" class=\"xueqiu_timleine_link\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://162.243.151.204/article/1716072-the-billion-dollar-molecule\" ><span class=\"\" >http://</span><span class=\"js-display-url\">162.243.151.204/article/1716072-the-bi</span><span class=\"url_invisible\" >llion-dollar-molecule</span><span class=\"url_ellipsis\"><span class=\"url_invisible\" >&nbsp;</span>…</span></a><br><br>这里真的引出4本书，我一起买来，used，48刀，估计拿来我也看不懂，呵呵，不过，比起准备投入的，好像知识总还是很便宜。<br><br><br><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Science-Business-Promise-Reality-Biotech/dp/1591398401/ref=pd_bxgy_b_img_z\" class=\"xueqiu_timleine_link\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://www.amazon.com/Science-Business-Promise-Reality-Biotech/dp/1591398401/ref=pd_bxgy_b_img_z\" ><span class=\"\" >http://</span><span class=\"js-display-url\">www.amazon.com/Science-Business-Promis</span><span class=\"url_invisible\" >e-Reality-Biotech/dp/1591398401/ref=pd_bxgy_b_img_z</span><span class=\"url_ellipsis\"><span class=\"url_invisible\" >&nbsp;</span>…</span></a><br><br>According to Pisano, the biotech industry&#39;s problems stem from its special character as a science-based business.
