This is the todo list will be summarized at the end of every working day. 
1. per bars: start data, end data handling, should cross calculation, save, load until reuse
2. Implement download and load all of the history data. 

Fixed.2. Draw could not print the chart correctly, need to go back to check the data saved. 
   Per 2. DataFrame add list, use the reverse order, why? But already correct the usage, totally wrong. 
   here, use assumption like, 
   C=turnpoint. Actually, should develop the further algorithm to catch the missing data, and fully fill the chart.
